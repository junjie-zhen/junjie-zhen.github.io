Abstract: Improving energy efficiency is essential for promoting a more sustainable and resource-efficient economic model. Energy technology and allocation efficiency are critical factors influencing regional energy performance, while the theory of synergistic development provides a novel perspective for advancing energy efficiency. The paper develops a model to decompose energy efficiency and applies a coupled coordination degree (CCD) framework to examine the interaction between technological progress and energy resource allocation across China from 2000 to 2022. The findings reveal that (1) most Chinese provinces maintained a moderate level of coordination in the CCD between energy technology and energy allocation efficiency, while only a few achieved high coordination. (2) Spatial analysis highlights significant regional disparities, largely attributed to the uneven spatial distribution of allocation efficiency. (3) Convergence testing confirms the presence of both σ and β-convergence, suggesting a narrowing of regional gaps in coordination over time. (4) Over time, the primary driver of coupled coordination has shifted from green finance to industrial structure. Interaction analysis indicates that multiple driving forces now collectively foster integrated improvements in energy efficiency. The study concludes by emphasizing the importance of synergistic development in advancing energy performance and proposes policy measures in three areas: the establishment of coordination mechanisms, tailored regional governance, and the refinement of market-based systems.
